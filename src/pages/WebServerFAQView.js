        <dd>
          A: Remove any sensitive information from your log files. Determine
          what constitutes sensitive data in your context. This typically

          <br />
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A: When working with log data, it's essential to strike the right
          balance between detail and efficiency. Log granularity matters, as
          overly detailed logs can overwhelm the analysis process. We recommend
          considering the necessary level of detail while being mindful of log
          size. This balance can significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of
          your log analysis. Additionally, utilizing structured log formats
          whenever possible is a valuable practice. Structured logs are easier
          for our tool to understand and process. They provide valuable context
          and can expedite the identification of issues within your logs,
          ultimately improving the efficiency of your log analysis process.
          Ensure that log entries have consistent timestamps. Inconsistent
          timestamps can lead to inaccurate analysis results. Use a standardized
          timestamp format across all logs.
